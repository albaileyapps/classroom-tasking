 A game for use in classrooms

Simply choose some tasks and your teams and you've got a ready to play game for any class or room size.

This is designed for use in classrooms and is based on Taskmaster (the TV show). Students complete tasks and the teacher awards points based on the criteria/their opinion. Some tasks do require a bit of prep so please have a read and only choose suitable ones.

First, choose a few tasks that are suitable for your students and situation. You can make your own tasks too. 

Then, press start and give your session a name. Your session will save automatically so you can play across several lessons if you want. And you can have sessions for different classes on the go at the same time.

Setup the scoreboard by clicking the edit teams button. 

On the game screen, use the numbered buttons to select a task. The task will be shown with a timer (timing is optional). Hand out any materials needed for the task and let your students get to work. When the task is over, go back to the game screen.

To award points, click on a team in the scoreboard. Use the number keys on your keyboard to add points. Use the up/down arrows to add/minus 1 point.
